# ModelVerse
ModelVerse is a cutting-edge 3D model showcase platform designed to allow creators to upload, display, and share their 3D models. While the platform initially focuses on showcasing personal models, it will expand to incorporate Web3 and AI technologies to redefine the way 3D models are interacted with and distributed.

## Features
3D Model Upload: Easily upload and showcase your 3D models.

Interactive Model Viewer: View models in a fully interactive 3D environment.

AI Integration: Utilize AI for automatic tagging, model recommendations, and optimization.

Web3/NFT Support: Enable blockchain-based ownership verification and NFT creation for 3D models.

Model Customization: Customize your model's environment, including lighting, textures, and backgrounds.

Community Interaction: Share models with the community and explore others' creations.
